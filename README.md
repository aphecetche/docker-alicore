Basic Docker container to be able to develop Alice software in a Linux environment (from a Mac, using the Docker for Mac).

This is only a base image. A more complete one can be found e.g. in [docker-alice-dev](https://github.com/aphecetche/docker-alice-dev).

The corresponding image is built at each commit and available at [docker
hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/aphecetche/centos7-ali-core/).
